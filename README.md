# EECS Graduate Forms Central

Project goal: implement a proof-of-concept for a better system for keeping track of graduate student requirements. This system will allow students to correctly understand degree program requirements and correctly fill out graduate school forms. The ideal final product is a system similar in functionality to the undergraduate DARs but expanded to incorporate the extra nuances of graduate school at UT.
